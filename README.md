# DeltaRedis
DeltaRedis uses the in-memory data structure store, [Redis](http://redis.io/), to help BungeeCord communicate with the servers 
it handles. 

BungeeCord uses player connections and special Bukkit/Spigot channels to communicate which makes it heavily dependent on
players. By using DeltaRedis, BungeeCord and servers can communicate (often faster and easier) than the provided BungeeCord methods.
